# Initiative 3: Deployment and Testing

#### Description: 
This initiative is focused on ensuring that the website is developed, tested, and deployed in a high-quality and efficient manner. The initiative includes multiple projects and tasks related to testing, quality assurance, and deployment.

#### Goals: 
- Ensure that the website is developed and deployed with high quality and reliability.
- Minimize the risks of errors, bugs, and security vulnerabilities in the website.
- Ensure that the website meets the specified requirements and objectives.
- Streamline the development and deployment process to improve efficiency and reduce costs.
- Increase user satisfaction and engagement by providing a high-quality website experience. 

#### Scope: 
- Development of a comprehensive testing strategy that includes unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.
- Creation of a quality assurance process that includes code reviews, automated testing, and manual testing.
- Implementation of a continuous integration and deployment process to ensure that changes are deployed to the website quickly and reliably.
- Monitoring and analysis of website performance and user behavior to identify areas for improvement.
- Collaboration with developers, testers, and other stakeholders to ensure that everyone is aligned on the testing and quality assurance processes.
- Development and implementation of a disaster recovery plan to ensure that the website can be quickly restored in the event of a failure or outage.

#### Outcomes: 
- Increased efficiency in software development and deployment processes.
- Reduced time and costs associated with manual testing efforts.
- Improved quality of software releases and faster time-to-market.
- Reduced risk of errors and defects in production environments.
- Improved collaboration and communication between development, testing, and operations teams.

#### Deliverables: 
- Playwright testing
- Google Analytics data, including page views, bounce rate, session duration 
- GitHub Actions
