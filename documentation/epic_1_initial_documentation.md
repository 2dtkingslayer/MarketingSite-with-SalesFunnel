# Epic 1: "Initial Documentation" 

#### Description:
The purpose of this epic is to devlope a comprehensive framework for organizing and prioritizing work in an Agile software development environment. The goal is to create a system that allows teams to easily identify and track high-level goals, break them down into smaller initiatives and epics, and ultimately develop user stories that align with the overall vision of the project, and to add this documentation to the project's Wiki.

#### Goals:
- Create themes, initiatives, epics, and user stories
- Assign user stories to team members
- Outline deadlines and requirements necessary for project completion
- Manage workload

#### User Stories:
- As a website developer, I want to be able to create and manage themes, initiatives, and epics in our Agile development process, so that I can better prioritize and communicate our goals to the team.
- As a project manager, I want to be able to generate an individual project activity report for each member of my team so that I can track their progress and identify any areas where they may need additional support.
- As a website developer, I want to implement basic error tracking using GitHub issues and issue templates so that I can quickly and easily report and track issues in my codebase.

#### Dependencies:
- Team members understand Agile development methodologies
- Ability to communicate and collaborate effectively
- Availability of technologies and resources
- Availability of team members

#### Risks:
- Additional overhead and administrative burden for team members
- Time needed to implement framework

#### Estimated Effort:
Take up to 3-4 days to finalize the documentation.

#### Business Value:
The business value of this epic lies in its ability to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of software development, leading to faster delivery of high-quality products that meet customer needs. By providing a clear and structured approach to development, this epic can also help reduce the risk of project failure or delays, ultimately saving time and effort.

#### Priority:
1, as this should be completed before continuing website development
