## Project Requirements

### Introduction to the Project and Grading System

The project has three levels of difficulty, which roughly correspond to IS218/601 (Basic), IS219 (Intermediate), and IS421 (Advanced). As per your respective course, you are required to complete the corresponding project level:

- IS218/601 students must submit the Basic project requirements.
- IS219 students must submit the Basic + Intermediate project requirements.
- IS421 students must submit the Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced project requirements.

We are including all of the levels in the assignment to show you what you will learn in the future and/or provide those who want to challenge themselves with a roadmap of what to do if they complete the project early. For instance, if you're in IS218/601 and complete the Basic requirements a week or two early, you might want to try implementing something from the Intermediate or Advanced project. While you cannot receive more than an A or additional credit for completing more than the required level, working on the advanced marketing and artificial intelligence features described in the Intermediate and Advanced project specifications could make your project much more impressive.
